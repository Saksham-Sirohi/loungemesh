# LoungeMesh AI Development Rules

This repository follows the development standards and guardrails defined in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Quick Reference
- **Coverage**: 100% statement, branch, and function coverage required (`npm test`).
- **Adapter Boundary**: UI components and Pinia stores must never import `lib-jitsi-meet` directly; all WebRTC calls must go through `MediaService` / `JitsiAdapter`.
- **Scaling**: Never hardcode container memory limits (`mem_limit`). Rely on spatial viewport culling (`receiverConstraints.ts`, 0 streams off-screen), 360p camera avatar / 720p screensharing capture budgeting, single-roundtrip `/init` room bundling, and connection pooling.
- **Security**: Never expose `joinPin` or raw internal database fields in API responses. Always sanitize via `sanitizeMeetingConfig`.
- **Domain Skills**: Consult specialized skills in `.agents/skills/` for architecture, scaling, security, deployment, eventyay integration, and testing.
